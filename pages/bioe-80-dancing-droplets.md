# BioE 80 - Dancing Droplets

One major application for learning Python is creating computational models of physical, chemical, or biological phenomenon. From modeling entire cells (See the work from the [Covert Lab](https://www.covert.stanford.edu/) here at Stanford) to individual proteins (See the work from the [Huang Lab](http://www.proteindesign.org/) here at Stanford), computational modeling is a major part of many research opportunities.

To help introduce you to how to approach modeling a system and how to work with Python, let's look at how we can model the Dancing Droplets we have been working with. To access the module, click on either the Google Colab or Binder buttons below!

    "## 1.0 - Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks is a special implementation of Python that enables you to run Python in an interactive environment in combination with textual annotations through a syntax called Markdown. Jupyter notebooks are split into 'cells' that either contain Markdown (plain text) or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.0 - Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a plain-text syntax that is interpreted into rich-text that you normally see in a word processor. If you would like full documentation, see the following [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown can automatically format multiple levels of headers (1-6) similar to a word-processer. Headers are indicated using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Header Title`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the number of `#` indicate the header level. (E.g. `### Header 3`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - Bold and Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "Bold and italics are indicated by wrapping the text in asterisks (\\*). Two asterisks (`**text**`) will result in **bolded text**. One asterisk (`*text*`) results in *italicized text*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 - Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unordered List\n",
    "To make an unordered list, use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordered List\n",
    "To make an ordered list, use the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Item 1\n",
    "2. Item 2\n",
    "3. Item 3\n",
    "```\n",

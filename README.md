# BioE Python Guide
Welcome to the BioE Python Guide! This is a resource to intrdouce students to working with Python in Jupyter Notebooks and/or Google Colab. This guide is adapted from BioE 103, BioE 279, BioE 300b, and materials from [Justin Bois](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2018/schedule.html).

## How to Use this Guide
This guide is split into a series of different modules focusing on different aspects of Python and the notebook enviornment. Each module will consist of a Google Colab notebook and/or a subpage that you can follow. Each Google Colab notebook is interactive and can be saved/edited for your own use. In addition to providing examples, there are optional exercise examples within these modules that you can use to test your understanding.
